# **Robopy**
### Description:
This is a MicroPython library designed to simplify Lego robot development by providing tools such as a built-in movement system with line following, grid movement and more.
It is easy to use and enables fast iteration during development. Currently, it only supports two-wheeled EV3 robots.

### How to Download/Install:
First, download the correct version for your setup. Currently, we only support EV3 robots.
